# Fraud-Detection-System
This project is designed to detect and prevent fraudulent activities using advanced machine learning and data analysis techniques. The system leverages Random Forest for anomaly detection, with MySQL as the database backbone, OTP for secure user login verification, and Power BI for comprehensive data analysis and visualization.

**Features:-**

1.Database: MySQL is used to store and manage transaction data, user information, and other relevant data for analysis.

2.Anomaly Detection: A Random Forest algorithm is implemented to identify unusual patterns and flag potential fraud cases.

3.User Verification: An OTP (One-Time Password) mechanism is integrated into the login process to ensure secure access.

4.Data Analysis & Visualization: Power BI is used to analyze the data and present insights through interactive dashboards.

**Tech Stack**

1.Backend: MySQL, Python (for Random Forest implementation), Flask

2.Frontend: HTML/CSS, JavaScript

3.Data Analysis: Power BI

4.Security: OTP-based user verification

**Future Work:-**

1.Cloud Integration: Plan to migrate data storage to a cloud platform for enhanced scalability and reliability.

2.Enhanced Security: Explore additional security measures, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and data encryption, to further protect sensitive information.
